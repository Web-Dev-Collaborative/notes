Joomla is fantastic because you could add or modify view or calculate intervening into [particular events](http://docs.joomla.org/Plugin). It only needs to add or modify correct files. If you would like:

  1. modify template
      * creating your template in /templates/your-template-name and
      * overwriting css or html about modules or components
  2. modify modules
      * overwriting html from templates/your-template-name/html
      * from administration, copying module and add it with different parameters
      * copying module and install it as new module
      * changing module by your plugin
  3. add new plugins
  4. add new components

**Zoo** is a big component. It is so important that it has also more ways to add or modify view or calculate.  
If you would like:

  1. modify template
      * from zoo administration interface
      * adding modules into zoo templates (full, related, item, teaser, ..)
  2. modify zoo component
      * from /media/zoo/applications with applications.php files
      * and all final files about full, related, item, teaser, .., templates
