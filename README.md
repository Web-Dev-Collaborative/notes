# My notes
This repository has been my tests of the github features. Since 2019, I loaded my blog on a jekyll theme forked from the repository [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids).

## What I done
- I forked the repository of [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids)
- I followed this macro [gist](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/6b6cdcfabed5e5976ba697544be714d6) guide
- I saved the branch named leonids as my sync with the original repository
- I created branch named custom for all changes with the branch named leonids
- I used the free icons of [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

## Changes
- I created 2 [projects](https://github.com/bilardi/notes/projects) where I mark my issues
- I moved the README.md of the repository forked into [CHANGES](CHANGES)
- and the old updates persist on the file [GOALS](GOALS)
