#### My notes
This page is my README.md file of my first [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bilardi/notes): it has been the place of my GitHub features tests. Since 2019, I have loaded my blog on a jekyll theme forked from the repository [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids).

What I done:
- I created 2 [projects](https://github.com/bilardi/notes/projects) where I mark my issues
- I forked the repository of [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids)
- I followed this macro [gist](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/6b6cdcfabed5e5976ba697544be714d6) guide
- I saved the branch named leonids as my [sync](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/97d4098c2ff21065d2d29c715dcb3812) with the original repository
- I used the free icons of [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- I redirected resume page on homepage because I have one [repository dedicated](https://github.com/bilardi/resume)
- I removed the original posts and moved the README.md of the repository forked into [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/bilardi/notes/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
- the old README.md of my notes persist on the file [GOALS.md](https://github.com/bilardi/notes/blob/master/GOALS.md)
- I converted my wordpress blog ITtips in this Jekyll theme by [benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter)

What missing:
- I have to manage the drafts contents
- I have to recover any notes around
